# React Music Player

A website that plays selected music files made with create-react-app.

## What I Learned

My first react project after the standard Tic-Tac-Toe and To-Do List is did following the official React and MDN tutorials. I learned alot about state management after I had too many useState declarations which promped me to learn and implement the useReducer hook.

The app originally use the useForwardRef and useImperativehandle to cover up my poorly thought out initial approach. I instead just lifted the app state again one level and no longer needed to use it. I learned how state and props affect a components lifecycle and how to minimise component rerenders and maximise perfomance when need be.

### Potential Future Features

- Pulling songs from some API instead of hardcoding the songs to the app.
